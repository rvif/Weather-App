# weather_app

 My project for the IP-I evaluation.


 â€¢ A simple Weather App, that uses two different API's to search and display different info regarding the current weather of a city.

1. Unsplash API : To update the backdrop images dynamically based on what the weather description of the city is.
2. OpenWeather API : To fetch all the details regarding weather and other meteorological phenomenon.

I have tried to use maximum CSS to improve the aesthetic of this Project.
